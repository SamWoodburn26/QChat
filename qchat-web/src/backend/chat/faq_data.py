    "question": "I am expecting an adjustment to my bill for meal plan, housing, health insurance or financial aid but it is not there and payment is due on 7/12. What should I do?",
    "answer": "We understand that it may take time for adjustments to meal plans, housing, health insurance and financial aid. In the meantime, as you prepare to pay your bill, please pay for the items that you intend to select (for example, if you are anticipating financial aid, please deduct it from your balance and pay that part). Then, we ask all students to review their invoice again in a couple of weeks and again after add/drop to pay any remaining balance. After add/drop, we will also review balances and will refund any payments made in excess. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.",
